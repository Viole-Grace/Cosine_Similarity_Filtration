-In statistics and related fields, a similarity measure or similarity function is a real-valued function that quantifies the similarity between two objects.
-Common similarity metrics include Jaccard Coeff, Tanimoto Coeff, etc.
-This takes a look at Cosine flitration and how its useful for feature abstraction.
